# **Nebis Quick Start**

**Nebis** is an in-memory database designed to combine the speed of RAM with the reliability of disk persistence.

### **What is Nebis?**
**Nebis** is a RAM-based database with optional disk persistence. It offers an HTTP-based API for universal accessibility, making it compatible with any programming language. Here's what makes **Nebis** special:

- **In-memory data processing:** For ultra-fast performance.
- **Disk persistence:** Reliable storage using JSON.
- **Dynamic structures:** Automates "table and column" management.
- **Built-in security:** AES-256 encryption and JWT authentication.
- **Offline synchronization:** Ideal for distributed and mobile systems.
- **Free and unrestricted alternative to Redis:** Nebis is designed to be a more accessible, faster, and flexible alternative to Redis, with no limitations on the number of databases or speed of operations.

**Nebis is completely free for open source projects** and for those who distribute their software for free. **It will always be free for the open source community** and for projects that do not generate revenue. If your software makes money (even if it is minimal), or if you use methods such as advertising to generate revenue, you will have to pay a very small fee for Nebis, much lower than Redis. However, if the use is strictly non-commercial or non-revenue-driven, Nebis is completely free.

### **Getting started**
#### **Prerequisites**
Nebis requires Python 3.8 or higher. Make sure Python is installed on your system. Optionally, you can install Docker if you prefer a containerized deployment.

#### **Installation**
```bash
pip install nebis-cli
```

#### **Running Nebis**
```bash
nebis
```

#### **Using Nebis with Nebis Cloud**
If you plan to use **Nebis Cloud** to manage your databases, you will need **nebis-cli**. It allows you to:

- Create and manage your account.
- Log in to your Nebis Cloud account.
- Create and delete databases.
- Get your unique Nebis URL for database connections.

#### **Using Nebis Locally**
If you plan to store your databases locally, you do not need **nebis-cli**. Simply download and import **Nebis** into your development project to store everything locally and start using the database without needing an internet connection.
